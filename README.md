# MySQL
Certainly! Here are the MySQL CREATE TABLE statements based on the database design we discussed. This script will create tables for users, transactions, payment methods, transaction logs, and user payment details.

```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `user_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `username` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    `email` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    `password_hash` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    `updated_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`)
);

-- Transactions Table
CREATE TABLE `transactions` (
    `transaction_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `amount` DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    `currency` VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    `status` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    `payment_method` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    `created_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    `updated_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`transaction_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users`(`user_id`)
);

-- Payment Methods Table
CREATE TABLE `payment_methods` (
    `method_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `method_name` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    `details` TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (`method_id`)
);

-- Transaction Logs Table
CREATE TABLE `transaction_logs` (
    `log_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `transaction_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `action` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    `timestamp` DATETIME NOT NULL,
    `details` TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (`log_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`transaction_id`) REFERENCES `transactions`(`transaction_id`)
);

-- User Payment Details Table
CREATE TABLE `user_payment_details` (
    `detail_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `method_id` INT NOT NULL,
    `details` TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (`detail_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users`(`user_id`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`method_id`) REFERENCES `payment_methods`(`method_id`)
);
```

### Notes:
1. **Data Types and Sizes**: Adjust the VARCHAR and DECIMAL sizes according to your specific needs.
2. **Timestamps**: Ensure that the application or database automatically populates the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.
3. **Security**: For `password_hash`, ensure that your application logic includes secure hashing of passwords.
4. **Indexing**: Depending on your query patterns, you might want to add indexes to frequently queried columns for performance optimization.
5. **Foreign Keys**: The foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity. Make sure the referenced tables and columns exist before creating these relationships.

This script provides a solid foundation, but be prepared to refine the schema as your application's requirements evolve.

# DB
Designing a database schema for a payment gateway service using MySQL, with a backend in Spring Boot, involves creating tables that can efficiently store and manage transaction data, user information, and other relevant details. Here's a conceptual design for such a database:

### Database Schema Overview

#### 1. **Users Table**
- **Table Name**: `users`
- **Description**: Stores user account information.
- **Columns**:
    - `user_id` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
    - `username` (VARCHAR)
    - `email` (VARCHAR, Unique)
    - `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
    - `created_at` (DATETIME)
    - `updated_at` (DATETIME)

#### 2. **Transactions Table**
- **Table Name**: `transactions`
- **Description**: Records details of each transaction.
- **Columns**:
    - `transaction_id` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
    - `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key to `users.user_id`)
    - `amount` (DECIMAL)
    - `currency` (VARCHAR)
    - `status` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
    - `payment_method` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'PayPal', 'Stripe', etc.
    - `created_at` (DATETIME)
    - `updated_at` (DATETIME)

#### 3. **Payment Methods Table**
- **Table Name**: `payment_methods`
- **Description**: Stores information about the available payment methods.
- **Columns**:
    - `method_id` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
    - `method_name` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'PayPal', 'Stripe'
    - `details` (TEXT) - JSON or similar format to store API keys or other configuration

#### 4. **Transaction Logs Table**
- **Table Name**: `transaction_logs`
- **Description**: Logs all transaction activities for auditing.
- **Columns**:
    - `log_id` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
    - `transaction_id` (INT, Foreign Key to `transactions.transaction_id`)
    - `action` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'created', 'updated', 'status_change'
    - `timestamp` (DATETIME)
    - `details` (TEXT) - JSON or similar format to store additional log details

#### 5. **User Payment Details Table**
- **Table Name**: `user_payment_details`
- **Description**: Stores user-specific payment details.
- **Columns**:
    - `detail_id` (Primary Key, INT, Auto Increment)
    - `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key to `users.user_id`)
    - `method_id` (INT, Foreign Key to `payment_methods.method_id`)
    - `details` (TEXT) - e.g., tokenized payment information

### Database Design Considerations

- **Normalization**: The schema is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `user_id`, `transaction_id`) for faster query execution.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Enforce foreign key constraints for data integrity between related tables.
- **Security**: Store sensitive information like passwords and payment details securely. For instance, use hashing for passwords and consider tokenization or encryption for payment details.
- **Timestamps**: Including `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps in your tables is useful for tracking changes and for audit purposes.

### Integration with Spring Boot

- **JPA/Hibernate**: Use Spring Boot's JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the MySQL database.
- **Repository Pattern**: Implement the repository pattern for data access, separating the business logic from the data access layer.
- **Transactions**: Utilize Spring's `@Transactional` annotation to handle transactions smoothly.

This schema serves as a foundational structure for your payment gateway service. It's scalable and adaptable to future requirements. You might need to adjust it based on your specific business needs and scale.

# Git
The issue you're facing suggests that the `payment-service_framework.zip` file was not successfully removed from the commit history during the rebase process. The error `fatal: pathspec 'payment-service_framework.zip' did not match any files` indicates that Git did not find the file in the current state of the repository during the rebase, which is expected if the file was added in a previous commit.

Here's an alternative approach using `git filter-branch`, which is a powerful tool for rewriting history. It can be used to remove files from the entire history of a branch.

1. **Remove the File from All Commits**:
  - Run the following command to remove `payment-service_framework.zip` from all commits:
    ```bash
    git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch payment-service_framework.zip" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
    ```

2. **Force Push the Changes**:
  - After successfully removing the file from all commits, force push your changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin main --force
    ```

This command will go through your commit history and remove the specified file from all commits. The `--ignore-unmatch` flag is used to avoid errors in commits where the file doesn't exist.

**Important Note**: `git filter-branch` is a very powerful command that rewrites history. It can have significant implications, especially if you're working in a shared repository. Ensure you have a backup of your repository before running this command. Also, inform any collaborators about this change, as they will need to rebase any work based on the old history.

After running these commands, the large file should be removed from your history, and you should be able to push your changes to GitHub.
